## Description

After reading the NestJS document, I think it would be a good idea to learn the official course which might be more dense and contains best practices while the document is trying to demonstrate everything in detail. 

## Hint

```bash
# Run the app in Development Mode (Watch mode)
$ npm run start:dev

# Generate controller
$ nest g co

# Generate controller in specified path in dry run mode
$ nest generate controller modules/abc --dry-run
```
